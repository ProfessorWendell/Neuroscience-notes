##### Abstract
- The circuitry mediating the integration of reward perception and adaptive behavioral responses has been further refined. Recent developments indicate that the nucleus accumbens has a primary role in motivational circuitry, whereas afferents to the nucleus accumbens, in part, subserve distinct functions. Dopaminergic afferents serve to signal changes in rewarding stimuli, whereas glutamatergic input from the amygdala serves to cue behavior to conditioned reward, and afferents from the prefrontal cortex integrate information from short-term memory into behavioral responses.
