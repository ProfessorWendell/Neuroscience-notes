#### Preface
- Theoretical analysis and computational modeling are important tools for characterizing what nervous systems do, determinging how they function, and understanding why they operate in particular ways. Neuroscinece encompasses approaches ranging from molecular and cellular studies to human psychophysics and psychology. Theoretical neuroscience encourages crosstalk among these subdisciplines by constructing compact represenations of what has been learned, building bridges between different levels of description, and identifying unifying concepts and principles. In this book, we present the basic methods used for these purposes and discuss examples in which theoretical approaches have yielded insight into nervous system function.
