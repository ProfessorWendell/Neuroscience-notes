#### Abstract
- The circuitry mediating the integration of reward perception and adaptive behavioral responses has been further refined. Recent developments indicate that the nucleus accumbens has a primary role in motivational circuitry, whereas afferents to the nucleus accumbens, in part, subserve distinct functions. Dopaminergic afferents serve to signal changes in rewarding stimuli, whereas glutamatergic input from the amygdala serves to cue behavior to conditioned reward, and afferents from the prefrontal cortex integrate information from short-term memory into behavioral responses.

### [Grounding neuroscience in behavioral changes using artificial neural networks (2024)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959438823001411)
#### Abstract
-Connectiong neural activity to function is a common aim in neuroscience. How to define and conceptualize function, however, can vary. Here I focus on grounding this goal in the specific question of how a given change in behavior is produced by a change in neural circuits or activity. Artificial neural network models offer a particularly fruitful format for tackling such questions because they use neural mechanisms to perform complex transformations and produce appropriate behavior. Therefore, they can be a means of causually testing the extent to which neural change can be responsible for an experimentally observed behavioral change. Furthermore, because the field of interpretability in artificial intelligence has similar aims, neuroscientists can look to interpretability methods for new ways of indentifying neural features that drive performance and behaviors.
